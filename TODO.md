# TODO
## FIX
* Horiz speed multiplier not applying when not holding down button
* vertical speed multipler too high
## FEATURE
* Enemies (dogs?)
* Catnip (:O) just the collectables for 100% run
* Lives(should we make the game harder so they can start with 9?)
* Death screen and death barriers(just a simple one)
# power up ideas
* shield just a basic shield
* shield but if you press q you shoot a projectile and the shield disappears when you press q
* sword is a long ranged meele attack high in damage but its not spammable requiring skill(very unreasonable)
# DOING
## FIX
* Camera movement during jump
* Basic movement
* gravity
* when hitting a and d at the same time animations still playing
## FEATURE
* collision
* fast fall
* short hop(yes very creative did not get these names from a certain platform fighter)
* 
# DONE
* animation(technically but we have updated things and just need to make the legs move on their own mimicing actual motion making it easier to be lazy)
* walls
